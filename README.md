This is a pilot Telehealth Characterization Study to characterize utilization of telehealth services across multiple different sources.
Based on previous substantial literature review, we are motivated to further investigate the niche populations seen using telehealth and how they could differ across characteristics such as race, gender, or age groupings.
Furthermore, with recent unprecedented usage of telehealth services given the COVID19 pandemic, there is much greater interest in both delivering and ensuring equitable utilization of telehealth care.
